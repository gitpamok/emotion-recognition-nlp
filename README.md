Emotional Recognition Using LSTM

1. Downloading the Emotion Recognition Dataset.
2. Importing the Dataset and Visualizing it.
3. Adding Labels to the Dataset.
4. Tokenizing and Stemming of the data.
5. Creating the Bi-Directional LSTM Model.
6. Analysing the results by plotting the Accuracy and Loss curves.
7. Creating a Confusion Matrix to conclude the Actual vs Predicted.

Project Brief:-
> Constructed a Bidirectional LSTM Neural Network  and executed sentiment analysis to predict 6 classes of emotions.
> Analyzed a Kaggle Dataset with 16000 rows of textual data & performed pre-training techniques such as Stemming and tokenizing to ensure the model understands 95% semantic ambiguity & has a deep understanding of emotional classification.
> Achieved 99% training accuracy through comprehensive training over 25 epochs and using a softmax activation function.
